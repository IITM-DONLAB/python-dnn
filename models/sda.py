 This tutorial introduces stacked denoising auto-encoders (SdA) using Theano.

 Denoising autoencoders are the building blocks for SdA.
 They are based on auto-encoders as the ones used in Bengio et al. 2007.
 An autoencoder takes an input x and first maps it to a hidden representation
 y = f_{\theta}(x) = s(Wx+b), parameterized by \theta={W,b}. The resulting
 latent representation y is then mapped back to a "reconstructed" vector
 z \in [0,1]^d in input space z = g_{\theta'}(y) = s(W'y + b').  The weight
 matrix W' can optionally be constrained such that W' = W^T, in which case
 the autoencoder is said to have tied weights. The network is trained such
 that to minimize the reconstruction error (the error between x and z).

 For the denosing autoencoder, during training, first x is corrupted into
 \tilde{x}, where \tilde{x} is a partially destroyed version of x by means
 of a stochastic mapping. Afterwards y is computed as before (using
 \tilde{x}), y = s(W\tilde{x} + b) and z as s(W'y + b'). The reconstruction
 error is now measured between z and the uncorrupted input x, which is
 computed as the cross-entropy :
      - \sum_{k=1}^d[ x_k \log z_k + (1-x_k) \log( 1-z_k)]
